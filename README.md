ABOUT ME 

Hello world. I am Thelma Osifo, a software development student at MITT.
I’m interested in helping companies make informed decisions leveraging on data, as well as creating functional websites and software applications.

My tech stack includes JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS 3, PostgreSQL, SQL Server Management Studio, and PowerBI. Feel free to check out my repositories and reach me at osifoaisosa@gmail.com.
